### Mod 5 Project - Building a Classification Model to classify Rock/Hiphop songs
The purpose of this project is to use use a song dataset from EchoNest to learn and classify if a song is either Rock or Hiphop.

#### Process
The process that I have done for this project are as following:
- Load and clean the data from EchoNest
- Perform EDA to understand the data
- Use DecisionTree, Logistic Regression and Random Forest to classify the data
- Use PCA to examine reducing of features
- Use Hyperparameter tuning to find the optimal models

#### Content of this repository
- datasets : this is the song datasets from EchoNest
- Project4.ipynb : this is the main technical Jupyter notebook that perform all data science process of this project.
- Presentation.pdf : this is the executive presentation that provide the final conclusion of this project

THANK YOU!
